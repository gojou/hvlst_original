          <h3 class="card-title">Our Story</h3>
          <p class="card-text">
            Like a lot of good things our company grew out of a passionate side-interest. <a href="#liz" class="h5">Liz Poling-Hiraldo</a> is passionate about the Girl Scout community in Croton-on-Hudson, leading both a Troop and acting as the local Service Unit Co-Manager. As a Troop Leader she was required to be certified in First Aid/CPR. After taking her class decided to become certified as an Instructor because she realized how important it is for everyone to have these skills. Since then she's become certified through multiple organizations to teach Babysitting and Child Care courses as well as Wilderness First Aid.

            Fast forward, we now have all the toys to teach Adult, Chid, and Infant CPR. We haven't cut corners because that's not something we do. Effective training involves not only presenting information, but making sure students practice the physical skills necessary to act competently in an emergency. We will offer open courses on a regular basis, and still support our local Scout Leaders, but our bread and butter is going to be reaching out to local businesses and community groups and training them in their locations with our equipment. We will provide A/V equipment (because not everyone has this stuff available), starter First Aid kits, personal protection eqipment (sterile gloves, breathing masks, etc.), and practice manikins.
